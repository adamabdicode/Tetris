# Tetris
Tetris is a game that aims to manipulate a set of geometric shapes divided into four blocks called "Tetraminos" as they fall onto the screen. The player can 
move Tetraminos left or right, rotate them to make them fit onto other Tetraminos, or make them fall faster onto the bottom. If you fill a
single line with 12 individual blocks, you can make a line disappear. If a completed line disappears, the player earns points. But as the game progresses, it becomes more challenging as the speed of the falling Tetramino increases. If a Tetramino reaches the top of the screen, the game ends.

# Key Features
**Languages and frameworks:** I developed the game entirely in Java using a Java UI framework called Swing.

**Tetramino:** The implementation features four distinct Tetramino that I managed to manipulate and shape.

**Controls:** Utilized different controls for the player to move the Tetramino. There is also a pause feature if the player wants a break. All of this ensures an enjoyable and intuitive user experience.

**Scoring System:** The game gets progressively harder as the player scores more points. I was able to implement a scoring mechanism to reward skillful play and 
also offer a competitive edge.

**Audio:** I carefully integrated audio cues for the Tetramino rotation and impact sounds. I also provided background music for the player.
