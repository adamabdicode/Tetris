# Tetris
Tetris is a game where the goal is to manipulate a set of geometric shapes divided into four blocks called "Tetraminos" as they fall down onto the screen. The player can 
move Tetraminos left or right, rotate them to make it fit onto other Tetraminos, or make them fall faster onto the bottom. You can make lines disappear if you fill a 
single line with 12 individual blocks. If a completed line disappears, the player earns points. But as the game progresses, it becomes more challenging as the speed of the 
falling Tetramino increases. If a Tetramino reaches the top of the screen, the game ends.
# Key Features
**Languages and frameworks:** I developed the game entirely in Java using a Java UI framework called Swing.
**Tetramino:** The implementation features four distinct Tetramino that I managed to manipulate.
**Controls:** Utilized different controls for the player to move the Tetramino. There is also a pause feature if the player is looking for a break. All of this ensures an 
enjoyable and intuitive user experience.
**Scoring System:** The game gets progressively harder as the player scores more points. I was able to implement a scoring mechanism to reward skillful play and 
also offer a competitive edge.
**Audio:** I carefully integrated audio cues for the Tetramino rotation and impact sounds. I provided background music for the player.
