# Tetris
Tetris is a game where the goal is to manipulate a set of geometric shapes divided into 4 blocks called "Tetraminos" as they fall down onto the screen. The player can 
move Tetraminos left or right, rotate them to make it fit onto other Tetraminos, or make them fall faster onto the bottom. You can make lines disappear if you fill a 
single line with 12 individual blocks. If a completed line disappears, the player earns points. But as the game progresses, it becomes more challenging as the speed of the 
falling Tetramino increases. If a Tetramino reaches the top of the screen, the game ends.
# Languages and Frameworks
For Tetris, I developed the game entirely in Java using Java UI frameworks called Swing.
